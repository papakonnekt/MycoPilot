# /mb work [target] [--range A-B] [--auto] [--dry-run] [--budget TOK] [--max-cycles N] [--allow-protected]

Run the executable engine over a plan or spec. Per work item, the engine dispatches an **implement** step to the auto-selected role-agent, an **mb-reviewer** review step, looped fix steps when the reviewer requests changes (capped at `max_cycles`), and a **plan-verifier** verify step before marking the item done. Severity gates, token budgets, protected-path checks, and the sprint context guard provide hard stops for `--auto` mode.

> **Scope.** Phase 3 Sprint 1 shipped `pipeline.yaml`. Sprint 2 shipped target resolution, range parsing, role-detection, plan emission, implement-step dispatch — and extended execution to spec tasks (`specs/<topic>/tasks.md`) as a first-class source alongside plan stages. **Sprint 3 (this command)** wires the review-loop, severity gates, fix-cycle, plan-verifier integration, `--auto` hard stops, `--budget` token tracking, and protected-path enforcement.
>
> **Phase 4 will add:** `--slim` / `--full` context strategy via `context-slim-pre-agent.sh` and `pre-agent-protected-paths.sh` runtime hooks; `superpowers:requesting-code-review` skill auto-detection in the installer.

## Why /mb work?

Plans declared with `/mb plan` carry stage markers, DoD, and TDD instructions. Specs created with `/mb sdd` carry `<!-- mb-task:N -->` markers in `specs/<topic>/tasks.md`, each linked to REQ-IDs. `/mb work` is the runtime that consumes both: pick a work item (stage or task), route it to the right role-agent (mb-backend, mb-frontend, mb-ios, mb-android, mb-architect, mb-devops, mb-qa, mb-analyst, with mb-developer as fallback), let the agent implement against the DoD, then put the diff through a real review-loop instead of trusting the implementer's self-assessment.

## How `/mb work` resolves your input

The first positional arg `<target>` resolves in this order:

| Form | Input | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Existing path (plan `.md` or spec `tasks.md`) | Used as-is, no search performed |
| 2 | Substring of a plan basename | Searches `<bank>/plans/*.md` (excluding `done/`); single hit wins, multiple = ambiguity exit |
| 3 | Topic name | Checks `<bank>/specs/<topic>/tasks.md`; if present with `mb-task` markers, resolves to that file |
| 4 | Freeform (≥ 3 words) | Exits 3; the driver presents candidates from both `plans/` and `specs/` and asks the user to confirm |
| 5 | Empty target | Uses the first plan link inside the `<!-- mb-active-plans -->` block of `roadmap.md` |

**Form 3** is the direct spec-task path: if you have `specs/inventory-sync/tasks.md` containing `<!-- mb-task:N -->` markers, `/mb work inventory-sync` will execute those tasks directly — no plan file required.

**Form 4** candidates include both `plans/*.md` and `specs/*/tasks.md`, so the user can pick either artifact type when input is ambiguous.

Underlying script: `bash scripts/mb-work-resolve.sh [target] [--mb path]`.

## Spec tasks as executable source (Sprint 2)

`specs/<topic>/tasks.md` is a first-class executable artifact, not a human-only scaffold. A tasks.md file is executable when it contains at least one `<!-- mb-task:N -->` marker.

Example tasks.md fragment:

```markdown
<!-- mb-task:1 -->
### Task 1: Implement repository interface

**Covers:** REQ-001, REQ-002

...DoD items...

<!-- mb-task:2 -->
### Task 2: Add persistence layer
...
```

When `mb-work-plan.sh` reads a spec tasks.md, it emits JSON Lines with `source=spec` and `kind=task`. The `covers` field lists the REQ-IDs the task satisfies.

## Plan-as-wrapper UX

A thin plan file can delegate execution to a spec by declaring `linked_spec` (and optionally `tasks`) in its YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: feature
topic: inventory-sync-sprint-1
linked_spec: specs/inventory-sync
tasks: 1-3
---
```

When `mb-work-plan.sh` encounters `linked_spec`, it:

1. Resolves `<bank>/specs/inventory-sync/tasks.md`.
2. Applies the `tasks: 1-3` range (overrides any `--range` flag).
3. Emits JSON Lines with `source=spec`, `kind=task`, and `covers` populated from the spec markers.
4. Sets `plan` to the basename of the wrapper plan (for traceability), not the spec.

If `linked_spec` is present but `tasks` is omitted, all tasks from the spec are included.

If `linked_spec` is absent, the plan is treated as a classic plan (`<!-- mb-stage:N -->` flow).

**When to use plan-as-wrapper vs direct spec execution:**

- Use `/mb work <topic>` directly when you want to run all pending tasks from a spec (simple case).
- Use a plan-as-wrapper when Sprint slicing is needed: you want a dated plan record for traceability but the actual work items live in the spec.

## Range parsing (spec §8.3)

`--range A-B` filters which work items run. The format auto-detects from the first marker in the target file:

- **`<!-- mb-stage:N -->`** markers → range is over plan stages.
- **`<!-- mb-task:N -->`** markers → range is over spec tasks.
- **Mixed markers in one file** → `mb-work-range.sh` exits 1 with an explicit error about mixed-format.

Forms: `N` (single), `A-B` (closed), `A-` (open-ended to max). Out-of-bounds → exit 1.

For plan-as-wrapper with `tasks: <range>` in frontmatter, the frontmatter range takes precedence over `--range`.

Underlying script: `bash scripts/mb-work-range.sh <plan-or-spec> [--range expr]`.

## JSON Lines schema

`mb-work-plan.sh` outputs one JSON object per work item:

```json
{
  "plan": "2026-05-21_feature_inventory-sync-sprint-1",
  "stage_no": 2,
  "item_no": 2,
  "heading": "Task 2: Add persistence layer",
  "role": "backend",
  "agent": "mb-backend",
  "status": "pending",
  "dod_lines": 5,
  "source": "spec",
  "kind": "task",
  "covers": ["REQ-001", "REQ-003"]
}
```

Field reference:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `plan` | string | Basename of the plan or wrapper plan file (for traceability) |
| `stage_no` | int | Sequential item number (backward-compat alias of `item_no`) |
| `item_no` | int | Sequential item number (same value as `stage_no`) |
| `heading` | string | Stage or task heading text |
| `role` | string | Detected role (backend, frontend, etc.) |
| `agent` | string | Resolved agent name (from `pipeline.yaml:roles.<role>.agent`) |
| `status` | string | `pending`, `in-progress`, or `done` |
| `dod_lines` | int | Number of DoD checkbox lines in the item body |
| `source` | string | `plan` for `<!-- mb-stage:N -->` items; `spec` for `<!-- mb-task:N -->` items |
| `kind` | string | `stage` (plan item) or `task` (spec item) |
| `covers` | array | REQ-IDs this task covers (empty list `[]` for stages without Covers) |

Existing consumers that read `stage_no` continue to work — `item_no` is an alias with the same value.

## Per-stage workflow Claude Code follows

When the user types `/mb work [args...]`:

1. **Resolve + range + plan emission.** Run `bash scripts/mb-work-plan.sh [--target ...] [--range ...] --mb <bank>`. The script outputs JSON Lines as described above.

   On `--dry-run`, prepend a `## Execution Plan` summary header and **stop**; do not dispatch.

2. **Initialise budget (if `--budget TOK` given).** Run `bash scripts/mb-work-budget.sh init <TOK> --mb <bank>`. Subsequent steps call `bash scripts/mb-work-budget.sh check --mb <bank>` after each Task dispatch; exit 1 = warn (log and continue), exit 2 = stop (halt the loop). Add tokens after each Task with `bash scripts/mb-work-budget.sh add <delta> --mb <bank>`.

3. **For each pending item** (iterate over the JSON Lines output):

   The stage body is read from the markers in the source file. For `kind=task` items, read between `<!-- mb-task:N -->` markers. For `kind=stage` items, read between `<!-- mb-stage:N -->` markers.

   ### 3a. Implement step

   Dispatch via `Task`:

   ```
   Task(
     description="mb-work item <N>: <heading>",
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     prompt="<contents of agents/<agent>.md>\n\nPlan: <plan path>\nStage: <heading>\n\n<full item body>\n\nLinked context: <if any>"
   )
   ```

   ### 3b. Protected-path check

   After the implement Task returns, gather the list of files it touched. Run `bash scripts/mb-work-protected-check.sh <files...> --mb <bank>`:

   - Exit 0 → proceed.
   - Exit 1 → if `--allow-protected` was passed, log a warning and continue; otherwise **halt** the loop and report which file violated which glob.

   ### 3c. Review step

   Resolve the reviewer agent name first:

   ```bash
   REVIEWER=$(bash scripts/mb-reviewer-resolve.sh --mb <bank>)
   ```

   The resolver reads `pipeline.yaml:roles.reviewer.agent` (default `mb-reviewer`) and honours `roles.reviewer.override_if_skill_present` when the named skill directory exists in `MB_SKILLS_ROOT` (default `~/.claude/skills`). With the `superpowers` skill installed it returns `superpowers:requesting-code-review`; otherwise it returns `mb-reviewer`.

   Dispatch the reviewer through `Task` with `$REVIEWER` as `subagent_type` (or as the agent prompt path when the resolver returns an `mb-`-prefixed local agent):

   ```
   Task(
     description="mb-work review item <N>",
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     prompt="<contents of agents/mb-reviewer.md>\n\nPlan: <plan path>\nItem: <heading>\n\nDiff:\n<git diff output>\n\nReview rubric:\n<pipeline.yaml review_rubric section>\n\n<previous issue list, on fix-cycle>"
   )
   ```

   The reviewer returns strict JSON.

   ### 3d. Parse & gate

   Parse the reviewer's stdout:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/mb-work-review-parse.sh < reviewer-stdout
   ```

   Then apply the severity gate:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/mb-work-severity-gate.sh --counts-stdin --mb <bank>
   ```

   - **Exit 0 (PASS)** → go to 3f (verify step).
   - **Exit 1 (FAIL)** → fix-cycle (3e).

   ### 3e. Fix-cycle

   - If `cycle < max_cycles` (from `pipeline.yaml:stage_pipeline[step=review].max_cycles`, override with `--max-cycles N`): re-dispatch the implementer Task with the issue list appended to the prompt. Increment `cycle`. Return to 3c.
   - If `cycle == max_cycles` and `pipeline.yaml:stage_pipeline[step=review].on_max_cycles == "stop_for_human"`: **halt** the loop, surface the open issues, ask the user how to proceed.
   - If `on_max_cycles == "continue_with_warning"`: log the unresolved issues, mark the item as `WARN`, proceed to 3f anyway.

   ### 3f. Verify step

   Dispatch the plan-verifier:

   ```
   Task(
     description="mb-work verify item <N>",
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     prompt="<contents of agents/plan-verifier.md>\n\nSource file: <plan or spec path>\nItem just completed: <N> — <heading>"
   )
   ```

   The verifier returns its 7-check structured report.

   - **Verdict PASS** → proceed to 3g.
   - **Verdict FAIL** → **halt** the loop. Surface the verifier's findings. The user decides whether to re-implement or abandon.

   ### 3g. Item done

   - Mark DoD items satisfied in the source file (plan or spec tasks.md).
   - Without `--auto`: prompt the user to confirm before moving to the next item.
   - With `--auto`: continue to the next item unless one of the hard stops (below) fired.

4. **End-of-run summary.** When all requested items are processed, summarise: items attempted, items PASS / WARN / FAIL, files touched, total budget spent. Run `bash scripts/mb-work-budget.sh clear --mb <bank>` to remove the budget state.

## Hard stops for `--auto`

The autopilot continues without per-item prompts **except** when:

| Trigger | Surfaced via | Halt? |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| `max_cycles` reached without `APPROVED` | step 3e + `on_max_cycles=stop_for_human` | yes |
| `plan-verifier` returns FAIL | step 3f | yes |
| `Write` / `Edit` attempt at a `protected_paths` glob without `--allow-protected` | step 3b (`mb-work-protected-check.sh`) | yes |
| `--budget` exhausted | `mb-work-budget.sh check` exit 2 after Task | yes |
| `sprint_context_guard.hard_stop_tokens` reached (190k default) | manual observation; halt and ask user to compact | yes |

When any hard stop fires, the loop halts even under `--auto`. The orchestrator surfaces the trigger, the item state, and the next reasonable action (rerun with adjusted flags, edit pipeline.yaml, compact, etc.).

## Arguments

| Flag | Meaning | Sprint |
|------|---------|--------|
| `<target>` | Plan / spec topic / freeform / empty | 2 |
| `--range A-B` | Range over stages (plan) or tasks (spec) or sprints (phase) | 2 |
| `--dry-run` | Print execution plan, don't dispatch | 2 |
| `--auto` | Skip per-item confirmation prompts; obey hard stops | 3 |
| `--max-cycles N` | Override `pipeline.yaml` review `max_cycles` | 3 |
| `--budget TOK` | Initialise token budget; halt at `stop_at_percent` | 3 |
| `--allow-protected` | Permit Write/Edit on `protected_paths` globs | 3 |
| `--slim` / `--full` | Context strategy for sub-agents — exports `MB_WORK_MODE=slim` (or `full`) for the loop subshell | Phase 4 (Sprint 2) |

## Examples

```bash
# Empty target: pick first active plan from roadmap.md mb-active-plans block
/mb work
/mb work --auto

# Execute all tasks from specs/inventory-sync/tasks.md (topic = Form 3 resolution)
/mb work inventory-sync

# Narrow to spec tasks 1-2 using --range
/mb work inventory-sync --range 1-2

# Single spec task by number
/mb work inventory-sync --range 3

# Plan-as-wrapper: thin plan delegates execution to linked spec
# (plan frontmatter: linked_spec: specs/inventory-sync, tasks: 1-3)
/mb work plans/2026-05-21_feature_inventory-sync-sprint-1.md

# Dry-run: show execution plan for a spec without dispatching
/mb work inventory-sync --dry-run

# Backward compat: classic plan with mb-stage markers (no linked_spec)
/mb work plans/2026-05-21_refactor_auth-service.md

# Classic plan with stage range
/mb work auth-refactor --range 2-4

# Autopilot with budget cap
/mb work --auto --budget 200000

# Allow up to 5 review cycles per item
/mb work --auto --max-cycles 5
```

```

## Out of scope (Phase 4)

- `--slim` / `--full` context strategy via `context-slim-pre-agent.sh` runtime hook.
- `--allow-protected` enforcement at Write/Edit hook level (deterministic check at step 3b stays in /mb work).
- `superpowers:requesting-code-review` skill detection wired by the installer based on `pipeline.yaml:roles.reviewer.override_if_skill_present`.

## Related

- `/mb plan <type> <topic>` — produces the plan file `/mb work` consumes.
- `/mb sdd <topic>` — creates `specs/<topic>/{requirements,design,tasks}.md`; `tasks.md` is directly executable by `/mb work`.
- `/mb config` — manage `pipeline.yaml` (roles → agent mapping, review_rubric, severity_gate, max_cycles, on_max_cycles, budget thresholds, protected_paths).
- `/mb verify` — explicit plan/spec verification (also runs as the verify step inside the loop).
- `/mb done` — close the session after a successful `/mb work` run.
