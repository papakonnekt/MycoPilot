## Plan decomposition — Phase → Sprint → Stage

Formal 3-level hierarchy for planning. **Choose the level by the size of the work — not everything needs to be wrapped in a Phase.**

> **Canonical decomposition note:** When a spec exists under `specs/<topic>/`, the
> `tasks.md` file is the canonical decomposition. Plan files act as sprint slices
> (via `linked_spec` frontmatter) or standalone tactical wrappers when no spec
> exists. Do not duplicate task definitions in both plan stages and spec tasks.

| Level | Purpose | Size threshold | Context |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Stage** | Atomic unit of work. Marker `<!-- mb-stage:N -->` inside a plan file | 1-5 files, ~5-15 tests, 5-30 min | Fits in one tool series |
| **Sprint** | Group of related Stages sharing the same architectural context. = **one plan file** | 3-7 stages, ≤15 files, ≤60 tests, ~3000 lines of new code | **≤ 200k tokens** (one session) |
| **Phase** | Major direction with ≥2 Sprints and dependencies between them | ≥2 Sprints, > 1 week of work, has roadmap/gates | Multiple plan files |

### When to use which level

| Work size | Structure | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| ≤ 3 stages, 1 session | **Plain plan**, no Phase/Sprint | Bugfix, small refactor |
| 3-7 stages, several days | One **Sprint** = one plan file | New mid-size feature |
| ≥ 2 Sprints with dependencies | **Phase** = roadmap + multiple plan files (one per Sprint) | Large initiative |

### 🔴 Hard rule — 200k context window per Sprint

**One Sprint must fit in a single Claude 200k-token context** — from reading code to final verification and Memory Bank actualization.

Budget per Sprint (indicative):
- ~30k — reading inputs (source files + plan + checklist)
- ~30k — planning + TDD red phase
- ~100k — implementation
- ~30k — verification + test runs + output
- ~10k — buffer for errors and corrections

**If you estimate a Sprint at >200k — split it into 2 Sprints** along an architectural boundary. Two clean Sprints beat one truncated Sprint.

**Symptoms that require a split:**
- > 5 large files (>500 lines each) to read
- > 15 new/modified files
- > 3000 lines of new code
- > 60 new tests
- cross-layer refactor (core + service + infra all at once, all large)

### Required per Stage — SMART DoD

Each Stage in a plan file must have:
- **Title** — what is being done
- **Actions** — concrete files/functions
- **Tests (TDD — BEFORE implementation)** — unit / integration / e2e where applicable
- **DoD** (SMART: Specific / Measurable / Achievable / Relevant / Time-bound) as checkboxes; each item answers «how do we verify?»
- **Code rules** — one-line reference to principles (TDD/SOLID/DRY/KISS/Clean Arch)

### Required per Sprint — Gate

Every plan file ends with `## Gate` — the single success criterion. Without a Gate, it's not a Sprint.

### Terminology

Use **Phase / Sprint / Stage** exactly. "Этап" is accepted historically in existing plans (= Stage), but new plans should use the English triple for consistency.

## New Memory Bank initialization (`/mb init`)

Creates the minimal structure:

```text
.memory-bank/
├── status.md       # Header + "Current phase: Start"
├── roadmap.md         # Header + "Current focus: define"
├── checklist.md    # Header + empty checklist
├── research.md     # Header + empty hypothesis table
├── backlog.md      # Header + empty sections
├── progress.md     # Header
├── lessons.md      # Header
├── experiments/    # Empty; filled by experiment authors (EXP-NNN.md)
├── plans/          # Empty; filled by /mb plan (YYYY-MM-DD_<type>_<topic>.md)
│   └── done/       # Empty; archived plans move here via /mb plan-done
├── notes/          # Empty; filled by /mb note (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_<topic>.md)
├── reports/        # Empty; free-form reports useful to future sessions
└── codebase/       # Empty; populated by /mb map (mb-codebase-mapper subagent)
                    #   STACK.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / CONVENTIONS.md / CONCERNS.md
                    #   Optional: graph.json + god-nodes.md via /mb graph --apply
                    #   Consumed by /mb context (summaries) and --deep (full)
```

---

## Drift checks (`scripts/mb-drift.sh`)

Deterministic consistency checks for `.memory-bank/` without AI calls. `mb-doctor` uses it in step 0 to save tokens when the bank is already clean.

### Usage

```bash
# Current project
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-drift.sh .

# Another project
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-drift.sh /path/to/project
```

### Output (stdout — `key=value`)

```text
drift_check_path=ok
drift_check_staleness=ok
drift_check_script_coverage=ok
drift_check_dependency=skip
drift_check_cross_file=ok
drift_check_index_sync=skip
drift_check_command=ok
drift_check_frontmatter=ok
drift_warnings=0
```

**Values:** `ok` (no problems), `warn` (drift found), `skip` (check not applicable — for example `dependency=skip` if there is no `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `go.mod`).

Diagnostic messages go to stderr with the `[drift:<name>]` prefix.

**Exit code:** 0 when `drift_warnings=0`, otherwise 1 (works for a pre-commit hook).

### 8 checkers

| Name | What it checks |
|------|-----------------|
| `path` | Links like `notes/X.md`, `plans/X.md`, `reports/X.md`, `experiments/X.md` in core files actually exist |
| `staleness` | `status.md` / `roadmap.md` / `checklist.md` / `progress.md` have not been untouched for >30 days |
| `script_coverage` | `bash scripts/X.sh` references point to existing files (project-local or skill-local) |
| `dependency` | Python version in `status.md` matches `pyproject.toml` (if present) |
| `cross_file` | Counts like "N bats green" are consistent across `status.md`, `checklist.md`, `progress.md` |
| `index_sync` | `index.json` mtime is newer than all `notes/*.md` files (otherwise reindexing is needed) |
| `command` | `npm run X` / `make X` references point to existing scripts/targets |
| `frontmatter` | `notes/*.md` files starting with `---` also contain a closing fence |

### Integration with `mb-doctor`

`mb-doctor` runs `mb-drift.sh` first:
- `drift_warnings=0` → report "ok", no LLM analysis needed
- `drift_warnings>0` → read warnings and then run agent Steps 1-4 (cross-reference checks, Edit fixes)

This saves ~80% of tokens in standard cases where the bank is already clean.

### Pre-commit hook (optional)

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/memory-bank/scripts/mb-drift.sh . || {
  echo "Memory Bank drift detected — run /mb doctor to fix"
  exit 1
}
```

## Custom metrics override (`.memory-bank/metrics.sh`)

Optional file. If present, `mb-metrics.sh` calls it instead of auto-detect. Use it when:
- the project has a non-standard structure (monorepo, multiple languages together)
- you need project-specific metrics (custom test runner, Kubernetes readiness, ML reward, etc.)
- auto-detect returns `stack=unknown`

The script must print `key=value` lines to stdout:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .memory-bank/metrics.sh — custom metrics for this project.

set -euo pipefail

echo "stack=custom"                       # arbitrary label
echo "test_cmd=make test"                 # how to run tests
echo "lint_cmd=make lint"                 # how to lint
echo "src_count=$(find src -type f | wc -l | tr -d ' ')"

# Any extra metrics (passed through to MB Manager as-is):
echo "coverage=$(coverage report | tail -1 | awk '{print $4}')"
echo "reward_mean=$(jq '.mean' results.json)"
```

After creating it, run `chmod +x .memory-bank/metrics.sh`. Validation: `bash scripts/mb-metrics.sh` should return `source=override` instead of `source=auto`.

## Context (`context/<topic>.md`) — `/mb discuss` output (Phase 2 SDD)

Captured by the 5-phase requirements-elicitation interview. Source for `mb-traceability-gen.sh` REQ → Plan → Test matrix.

# Context: <topic>

## Purpose & Users

Who uses this, what problem does it solve, what are the success criteria?

## Functional Requirements (EARS)

Each line uses one of the 5 EARS patterns (Ubiquitous / Event-driven / State-driven / Optional / Unwanted).
IDs are project-wide monotonic — get the next one via `bash scripts/mb-req-next-id.sh`.

- **REQ-001** (ubiquitous): The system shall ...
- **REQ-002** (event-driven): When <trigger>, the system shall ...
- **REQ-003** (state-driven): While <state>, the system shall ...
- **REQ-004** (optional): Where <feature>, the system shall ...
- **REQ-005** (unwanted): If <trigger>, then the system shall ...

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Performance — ...
- **NFR-002**: Security — ...
- **NFR-003**: Scale — ...

## Constraints

Hard limits (regulatory, technical, organizational) that cannot be relaxed.

## Edge Cases & Failure Modes

What breaks at the boundaries? What happens when dependencies fail?

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded — to prevent scope creep during planning.
```

Validate REQ lines via `bash scripts/mb-ears-validate.sh context/<topic>.md`. Exit 0 = all valid; exit 1 = violations on stderr.

## Spec Requirements (`specs/<topic>/requirements.md`) — Phase 2 Sprint 2

EARS-only requirement list. Created by `bash scripts/mb-sdd.sh <topic>`. If `context/<topic>.md` exists, the EARS section is copied verbatim.

```markdown
# Requirements: <topic>

> Spec triple — see also: design.md, tasks.md.
>
> EARS patterns:
> - Ubiquitous:        `The <system> shall <response>`
> - Event-driven:      `When <trigger>, the <system> shall <response>`
> - State-driven:      `While <state>, the <system> shall <response>`
> - Optional feature:  `Where <feature>, the <system> shall <response>`
> - Unwanted:          `If <trigger>, then the <system> shall <response>`

```

## Spec Design (`specs/<topic>/design.md`) — Phase 2 Sprint 2

Architecture + interfaces + decisions backing `requirements.md`.

```markdown
# Design: <topic>

## Architecture

<!-- Layering, data flow, dependency direction. -->

## Interfaces

<!-- Protocol/ABC/interface definitions that anchor contract tests. -->

## Decisions

<!-- ADR-style entries: Context / Options / Decision / Rationale / Consequences. -->

## Risks & mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
|      | H/M/L       | H/M/L  |            |
```

## Spec Tasks (`specs/<topic>/tasks.md`) — executable task format

`specs/<topic>/tasks.md` is a **first-class executable artifact**. Each task is wrapped
in `<!-- mb-task:N -->` markers so `mb_work_items.py` (and `/mb work <topic>`) can parse
and execute it. Spec tasks are the canonical decomposition; plan files may reference them
as sprint slices via `linked_spec` frontmatter.

Validate with `bash scripts/mb-spec-validate.sh <topic>` before running `/mb work`.
Upgrade legacy `## N. ...` style with `bash scripts/mb-spec-tasks-migrate.sh <topic>`.

```markdown
# Tasks: <topic>

<!-- mb-task:1 -->
## 1. <task title>

**Covers:** REQ-NNN
**Role:** <implementer role, e.g. backend>
**What:** <concrete actions — files, functions, behaviour>
**Testing:** <unit tests: X; integration tests: Y>
**DoD:**
- [ ] concrete, measurable criterion (SMART)
- [ ] tests pass
- [ ] lint clean
<!-- /mb-task:1 -->

<!-- mb-task:2 -->
## 2. <next task title>

**Covers:** REQ-NNN
**Role:** <role>
**What:** ...
**Testing:** ...
**DoD:**
- [ ] ...
<!-- /mb-task:2 -->
```

---

## Plan as execution wrapper

A plan file can be a thin sprint slice over an existing spec. Declare the link in
YAML frontmatter at the top of the plan file:

```yaml
---
linked_spec: specs/inventory-sync
tasks: 1-3
---
```

`linked_spec` — path to the spec directory (relative to `.memory-bank/`).
`tasks` — optional range; limits `/mb work` to that task subset for sprint slicing.

The plan basename is used for traceability only. Spec tasks remain the source of truth.
